This file should run in the devtools console or in devtools sources->snippets for debugging in the this website: https://agendamentos.mne.gov.pt/en/schedule/form/calendar
Note:
A few seconds after i started running the scripts i got "Server error" and i assume the server blocked my requests due to high http request frequency
(Every "nextMonth" \ "prevMonth" click is making and http request)
So this code was not properly debugged and could potentially have errors
